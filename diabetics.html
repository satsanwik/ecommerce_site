    <h2>Diabetes</h2>
    <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is
        your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps
        glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or
        any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.
        <br><br>
        Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you
        can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.</p>
